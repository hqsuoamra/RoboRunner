## Game Description
Beat Blitz is a rhythm-based game where you play as a hero defending the surface from ancient Earth-dwellers. These ancient beings have emerged from the underground, their civilization and culture revolving around rhythm and noise.

## Gameplay
Your character stands in the middle of a battlefield filled with remnants of previous battles. You control a character that hits objects, the weapons of the ancient Earth-dwellers, to the beat of the ancient Earth-dwellerâ€™s battle song. These weapons come towards you from both the left and right.

Your character wields a sword used to slice the weapons. You must time your attacks according to both the location and timing of the weapons. These weapons are packed with ancient power and if not destroyed, will cause great harm.

There are different types of weapons with different abilities. These weapons have ancient markings on them, infusing them with different powers. One such power is the Ignis, which will cause a smokescreen that will block the view of other weapons from the user.

## How to Win
The game is won by successfully defending against the ancient Earth-dwellers' attacks. Good luck!

## Controls
Use the **left and right arrow keys** on your keyboard to control the character. To use the sword, press the **space bar**.
